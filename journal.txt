Title: Oxidation kintetics of uranium-oxide reaction

Introduction:
the oxidation kinetics of uranium in air has been studied using finite difference schemes.

Adding second reference to intro J Bloggs 


MEthodology:

Simulations using Crank-nicolson methods. finite difference method as described in Adam Smith 2007.

Conclusions:
Conclusions splendid.
